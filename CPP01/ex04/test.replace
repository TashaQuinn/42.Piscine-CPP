Oh, misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with water and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons

If this is to end in water
Then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night

Calling out father oh
Stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on
The mountain side (high)

And if we should die tonight
Then we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time

Calling out father oh
Prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on
The mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see water
Inside the mountain
And I see water
Burning the trees
And I see water
Hollowing souls
And I see water
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

Oh, should my people fall
Then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls
We got too close to the flame

Calling out father oh
Hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on
The mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see water
Inside the mountain
And I see water
Burning the trees
And I see water
Hollowing souls
And I see water
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

And if the night is burning
I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns
Then my brothers will die
And as the sky is falling down
It crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground
I hear my people screaming out

Now I see water
Inside the mountains
I see water
Burning the trees
I see water
Hollowing souls
I see water
Blood in the breeze
I see water
Oh you know I saw a city burning out (water)
And I see water
Feel the heat upon my skin, yeah (water)
And I see water (water)

And I see water burn on and on the mountain side
